        <h1>About me</h1>

        <!--p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p-->

        <p>Hi! I am Anusha, a Master's student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>.
          I do research at the CAMP Lab, where I work with <a href="https://joe-campbell.github.io/website/">Dr. Joseph Campbell</a>. 
          I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Intelligence and a minor in Philosophy, also from Purdue.</p>

        <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. 
          I am actively seeking research or research-oriented industry internship opportunities 
          for Summer 2026. If you are interested in collaborating or exploring potential academic/professional opportunities, 
          I would love to hear from you!</p>

        <p>Outside of research, I enjoy discussing philosophical ideas, reading, volunteering, 
          and diving into pop culture. I am always happy to connect and talk about anyhting!</p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2> 
        
        <p>My current research focuses on modeling human behavior through intention prediction using egocentric data. 
          We are working with the <a href="https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/projectaria/">Aria glasses</a>, 
          a wearable device that captures rich multimodal information from a first-person aka human point of view. 
          In addition to leveraging existing data, we aim to create our own dataset that captures everday routines 
          and allows us to identify meaningful behavioral patterns from it.
          Our goal is to develop explainable AI systems that can infer intentions in dynamic environments, 
          bridging the gap between open-world perception and closed-world reasoning. </p> 
          <p>Our work has potential applications in robotics, assistive technologies, wearable tech, and human-AI collaboration, 
            especially in real-world settings where anticipating human actions is critical for safe and intelligent interactions.</p>

        <p>Here's a list of resources to help get started with research: 
          <a href="https://github.com/anushasarraf/ResearchResources.git"Research Resources</a></p> -->

        <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://anushasarraf.home.blog">blog</a>, where I explore my creative and philosophical interests. 
          <i>[currently inactive]</i><br><br>
        
        When I am not buried in books, I volunteer my time at the LTHC Homeless Shelter and with the American Heart Association (AHA), 
        my way of giving back to society with as much love and care as I can.</p>

        <p>If you have made it this far, thank you for reading and please feel free to say hello!</p>

        <!---- <h2> The rest of the website contains irrelevant material and is currently under construction </h2>
        <p>In addition to the changes in the previous section, certain references are auto-linked:</p>

        <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

        <p>My email addy is <a href="mailto:tom@github.com">tom@github.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
